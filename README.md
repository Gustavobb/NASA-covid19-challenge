# NASA-covid19-challenge

From May/30/2020 to May/31/2020, **NASA** hosted the international Hackaton, with the theme **"SPACE APPS COVID-19 CHALLENGE"**. There were [twelfth challenges](https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/covid-challenges), wich [our team](https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/covid-challenges/quiet-planet/teams/toruk-makto-1/project) found most interesting one named **"Quiet Planet"**. The name of the team, [Toruk Makto](https://james-camerons-avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Toruk_Makto), actually came from the idea of strenght, once in Avatar, this creature is considered as strong.

<a name="challenge"></a>The challenge
======

Below, you can see a brief introduction for the chosen challenge written by **NASA**. For more information, visit the [official description for this problem](https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/covid-challenges/quiet-planet/details)

> **Quiet Planet**:
The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting social distancing recommendations and related restrictions have led to numerous short-term changes in economic and social activity around the world, all of which may have impacts on our environment. Your challenge is to use space-based data to document the local to global environmental changes caused by COVID-19 and the associated societal responses.

<a name="ideia"></a>The solution
======

Our team decided to follow the idea of hope, once we are living an era of bad news and desperation. We wanted to show that by staying at home, you are not only preventing the spread of the virus, but also helping the planet to heal from harmful human activities. This is our official solution:

> With the Coronavirus crysis all of humanity has been struggling not only with the loss of many lives, but also with all the negativity surrounding TV news and social media. No one has positive expectations. But there is hope. Nature is feeling the impacts of man's distance. With this in mind, our team created LockDown Hope, a web platform in which anyone around the globe can see the positive environmental impact that emerged with the Covid quarantine, from the changes in air pollution to urban heats. They can also take a simple quiz that will show them how the changes in their daily life have positively impacted the environment, which was made using the data given to us by Nasa. We want to give people hope that something good can come out of this, presenting everyone with a way of understanding our relationship with this planet, and how important our daily actions really are. Letâ€™s show people that responsability lies in their hands, and hopefully make lasting positive change in this world.

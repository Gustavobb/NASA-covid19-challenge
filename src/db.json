        "description":"Carbon dioxide is one of the many gases that contributes to global warming. Its concentration in our atmosphere has been growing a lot especially due to fossil fuels combustion. However, during the social isolation its emission has greatly decreased, since people have had to stay home and cannot use their vehicles. Also, polluting industries reduced their emission due to the lack of workers in the marketplace. It was found in April 2020 that after some countries decreed a more flexible quarantine the CO2 emission rate rose again. Hopefully during and after the lockdown we can work on reducing the CO2 emission.",

As CO2, it is released in the atmosphere due to the burning of fuel, and its emission has also been reduced due to the Covid quarantine for the same reasons as CO2. NASA was able to create an amazing comparison of the NO2 pollution along the american east coast from 2015 to 2020, and the visible impact generated from the lockdown is absolutely amazing as you can see below.
